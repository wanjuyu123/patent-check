PAT-001,"Advanced Radar System for Object Detection","An automotive radar system is disclosed that operates in the 77 GHz frequency band. The system uses a novel waveform modulation technique to improve detection range and velocity resolution for tracking vehicles and pedestrians, thereby enhancing driver safety."
PAT-002,"Method for Reducing Radar Signal Interference","This patent describes a method for mitigating multi-radar interference. By dynamically adjusting the chirp parameters of the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signal, the system can filter out noise from other nearby radar sources, ensuring reliable performance in dense traffic."
PAT-003,"Compact Radar Antenna Assembly","A compact and low-profile antenna assembly for a vehicle radar sensor. The design integrates the radiating elements and the feeding network on a single substrate, reducing manufacturing costs and size while maintaining high gain and wide field of view."
